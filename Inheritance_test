/* In Visual Studio create a project called "Inheritance Test." 
 * Think about inheritance. Come up with a "base class." 
 * Create a base class with at least 3 public members and at least 3 public methods. Declare some of the methods as "virtual." 
 * In your comments tell me why we are using the keyword "virtual." 
 * Your methods do not have to return anything, they can just write information out to the console.
 * Now create 2 derived classes that extend the base class. Override the virtual methods and add at least 1 public method and 1 public member to the derived classes.
 * In the Main method create an instance of each derived class. Prompt the user for the values of every member in the base and derived classes. 
 * Initialize the members with the values the user enters. 
 * Display all of the info for each object including the members and methods from the base and derived classes.
